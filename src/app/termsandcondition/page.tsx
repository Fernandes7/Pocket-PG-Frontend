            <h2 className={styles.heading3}>OUR ROLE:</h2>
            <p className={styles.p1}>
            PocketPG provides registered users (referred to as "User") with the option to make rental payments through its platform, which includes the website and mobile app. 
            These payments are processed using a third-party payment gateway. By using this platform for rental payments, the User acknowledges that there is a valid lessor and lessee
             relationship with the Beneficiary, and the transferred amount represents the actual rental value as per the agreement. PocketPG's role is solely to facilitate these 
             rental payments from the User to the Beneficiary and does not involve itself in the underlying transactions between the User and the Beneficiary. The User is responsible 
             for complying with any applicable regulations regarding such payments and will be held accountable for any non-compliance or defaults. PocketPG is not a financial 
             institution and does not provide banking or related financial services. To provide the services and process transactions, PocketPG may utilize the services of one or 
             more third parties. PocketPG is not an agent of the Lessor, the Lessee, or any other party involved in the remittance process.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2 className={styles.heading3}>KYC (Know Your Customer):</h2>
            <p className={styles.p1}>
             While the User is solely responsible for verifying the transaction's authenticity, PocketPG may request necessary documents or details from the User and the
             Beneficiary to substantiate the lessor and lessee relationship, such as the Rental Agreement, PAN Card, Aadhar Card, etc. If the remittance amount exceeds INR 50,000, 
             the User will be required to provide PAN card details or any other document/information as required by law. During Aadhaar-based verification, the User authorizes 
             PocketPG to download the Aadhaar XML from the UIDAI website to verify KYC details.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
        <h2 className={styles.heading3}>Authorization:</h2>
            <p className={styles.p1}>
            By initiating a transaction on the platform, the User authorizes PocketPG to hold, receive, and disburse funds according to the payment instructions to the designated
            bank account of the Beneficiary. This authorization allows PocketPG to charge the specified amount to the User's bank account, credit card, UPI account, debit card,
            payment wallets, or other enabled payment instruments on the platform for remitting the amount to the designated bank account of the Beneficiary. When the User instructs 
            PocketPG to pay the Beneficiary, they authorize and direct PocketPGl to allocate the payment (after deducting applicable fees, service charges, or other amounts specified 
            in the agreement) to the designated person. In case the transaction cannot be processed due to incomplete details provided by the User, PocketPG will refund the amount after
            deducting relevant service charges, transaction fees, and penalties.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
        <h2 className={styles.heading3}>Transaction Terms:</h2>
            <p className={styles.p1}>
            The User is responsible for providing accurate bank account details of the Beneficiary during the transaction, and under no circumstances shall  PocketPG 
            be held accountable for any incorrect credit due to inaccurate bank details. The User is also responsible for any fraudulent transactions that occur through their bank account, credit card, 
            or any other payment method due to their negligence or sharing of financial details with third parties. PocketPG cannot be held responsible for such fraudulent transactions, and no refund 
            will be issued once the money is successfully credited to the designated bank account of the Beneficiary. PocketPG reserves the right to delay, suspend, or reject a transaction if there 
            are financial or security risks, suspicion of unauthorized or fraudulent activity, violation of the terms of the agreement, disputes, or any other unusual circumstances.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h2 className={styles.heading3}>Liability:</h2>
            <p className={styles.p1}>
            The User agrees not to hold PocketPG liable for any disputes or issues arising between the User, the recipient, or any financial institution. The User agrees to indemnify
            and hold PocketPG, its affiliates, and employees harmless against any claims or actions by any person or regulatory authorities related to transactions conducted with incorrect
            details or credited to the wrong account.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h2 className={styles.heading3}>Suspicious/Fraudulent Transactions:</h2>
            <p className={styles.p1}>
            If the User observes any suspicious or fraudulent transactions, they are required to notify PocketPG immediately. It is the User's responsibility to maintain the 
            confidentiality of their financial details and not share them with others. PocketPG will take necessary measures to address reported suspicious/fraudulent transactions 
            but will not be liable for any refunds or liabilities to any person or authority if the money has been successfully credited to the designated bank account of the Beneficiary
            as provided by the User.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h2 className={styles.heading3}>Refunds:</h2>
            <p className={styles.p1}>
            If PocketPG is unable to transfer the rental amount to the designated bank account of the Beneficiary due to technical issues, a refund will be issued to the same 
            account from which the remittance was initiated. However, once the amount has been successfully credited to the Beneficiary's designated bank account, FindMyHostel will
            not be liable to repay or refund the amount to the User. In case of chargebacks, if a transaction is disputed, reversed, unauthorized, or allegedly unlawful, suspicious, 
            or in violation of the agreement, the Beneficiary will be responsible for reimbursing PocketPG for any associated chargebacks, fees, fines, or penalties. The User/Beneficiary 
            is expected to cooperate in the investigation of disputed transactions, and failure to do so may result in an irreversible chargeback for which PocketPG shall not be held liable.
